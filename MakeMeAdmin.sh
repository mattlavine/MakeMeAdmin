# This script will accomplish the following:
# 			- Check to See if Self Service User is the same as the one assigned to this
#			  computer in the JSS
#			- If so, will grant the local user currently login in admin rights
#			- If not, will get a prompt that this computer is not assigned to them
#
# In order for this script to work effectively you will need to have Login enabled for
# Self Service and will need to add the JSS API User account & Password to script
# variables $4 & $5 in the JSS, as well as enter the jssURL below.
#
# Exit Code Descriptions:
# 			exit 1 - User Running Policy Doesn't Match User Assigned in JSS
# 			exit 2 - No JSS User Assigned in JSS
# 			exit 3 - JSS is not Accessible
#			exit 5 - Unknown Error
